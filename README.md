## Springrid

- [x] **What, why and who?**

Ilias Mesbahi, Jonas Dreessen, Kenneth Van Der Strieckt en Tine Vancorenland created a fictional bouncy castle company called Springrid as a group project during their training at BeCode to become Junior Webdevelopers.

As instructed by...

Free for personal and commercial use as described in the licence document "licence.txt".

- [x] **How**

To properly use this website, you should:

- link your html file to the open source toolkit Bootstrap
- link your html file to Font Awesome
- import Google Fonts (Roboto, Montserrat, Droid serif, Bitter, Jaldi)

* [x] **Invent a company together and think of four pages that the company needs.**

We created a fictional bouncy castle company called Springrid, (which already exists; but best name ever so we're gonna use it for this fictional webdevelopment project but will never translate it to reality).

![Springrid](/imagecompressor/logo.png)
needs four pages:

- What do we do?
  - favicom
  - header with navbar
  - banner and title
  - welcome text
  - extras: vacancies, other events, charity
- What does it cost?
  - prices
- Why should someone pay us?
  - pictures of previous events
- How can you reach us?
  - footer with contact info

---

- [x] **Divide those pages amongst the group and each design one page.**

| What                           | Who     |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| header, navbar, banner, extras | Jonas   |
| welcome, prices                | Tine    |
| pictures                       | Kenneth |
| footer                         | Ilias   |

---

- [x] **Once you are all finished, join those pages together into one page and publish it.**

We collect all info at Jonas for further styling. He used one image in the header and used those colors to design a cohesive looking website... Curious? [Springrid](https://jonasdreessen.github.io/Springrid/)

We publish this project on Github to see a 'real life' result without further commercial purpose.
